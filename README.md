# TGL Node.js course - Asynchronous Code Examples

This repository contains examples for working with asynchronous code in Node.js. The examples are located in the `asyncMethods` folder, which contains three files demonstrating different methods for handling asynchronous operations.

## Folder

- `asyncMethods/` - Contains examples showcasing different approaches to handling asynchronous code:

  - `callbacks.js` - Examples demonstrating the usage of callbacks for handling asynchronous operations.
  - `async-await.js` - Examples showcasing the use of async/await for handling asynchronous code in a synchronous style.
  - `promises.js` - Examples illustrating the usage of promises for handling asynchronous tasks.

## Additional Files

The following additional files provide supplementary learning materials:

- `loop.js` - Demonstrates the event loop functionality in Node.js.
- `event.js` - Shows the usage of the events library in Node.js.

Feel free to explore the code in the `asyncMethods` folder to understand the different approaches for dealing with asynchronous operations in Node.js.

## Usage

To run the examples, navigate to the `asyncMethods` folder and execute the individual files using Node.js. For example:

```bash
node asyncMethods/callbacks.js
