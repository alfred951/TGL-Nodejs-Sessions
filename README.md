# TGL Node.js course - Main

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide for learning asynchronous programming in Node.js. It is organized into different branches, each representing a session from the course.

## Branches

1. `session-1` - Node.js basic libraries (fs, path, os).
2. `session-2` - Working with callbacks and event loop.
3. `session-3-nodejs` - A basic server using Node.js Http library.
4. `session-4-express` - A basic server using the Express framework.

Feel free to switch to any specific branch to explore the content related to each session.

Each branch contains its own set of files, including examples and detailed instructions on how to run them. Follow the specific README instructions in each branch to get the code running.

We hope this repository helps you gain a solid understanding of asynchronous programming in Node.js. Happy learning!
